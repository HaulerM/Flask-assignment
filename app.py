#To create a simple Flask app that returns your name, follow these steps:

#1. Install Flask: If you haven't already, you need to install Flask. You can do this using pip. Open your terminal and run:
   
 #  pip install Flask
   

#2. Create a new Python file: Create a new file called app.py (or any name you prefer).

#3. Write the Flask app code: Open app.py in a text editor and add the following code:

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
     return "My name is Musa Haulah"

if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(debug=True)
   

   #Replace [Your Name] with your actual name.

#4. #Run the Flask app: In your terminal, navigate to the directory where your app.py file is located and run:
   
   #python app.py
   

#5. Access the app: Open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/. You should see a message that says "My name is [Your Name]".

#That's it! You've created a simple Flask app that returns your name. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
